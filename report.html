<!--Introduction: What is the essential story being told by your site and what type of structure
did you choose to implement.-->

I built a website called "The Daily Beagle.
This is a 6 page website that covers news and interest in Long Beach, CA.
Each page of the webstie covers various topics and stories related to Long Beach, CA and important news.
The website structure first has a homepage, which then link swith all the other pages: World News, Local News, Real Estate, About Us and Log In.
Each page has navigation that is responsive at the top of the page and also articles related to each theme of a page.

<!--State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website. These could include
guest speakers, other websites, artists, developers etc.-->

Three things inspired me.

1. I live in Long Beach and I am very passionate about all the events happening in Long Beach.  
Long Beach is a very exiciting city with non-stop events.
We are famous for the Queen Mary, Long Beach Grand Prix, diversity, and now our downtown development. 
This site is first and foremost for Long Beach resident who want to be in the know.

2. I'm love to stay informed about the global news and what is happening around the world.  There is not a day that goes by that I don't read the news about events happening in every continent.
As much as I like Long Beach, I like to be aware of what is going on gobally. 
Since Long Beach risdent are so divese, we are among top 25 most diverse cities, I feel its resident are also curious what is going on around the world.
This site provides that.

3. Finally, I like dogs and Spiderman.  In spiderman, there is a famous newspaper called the Daily Bugle, which is a fictional New York City tabloid newspaper.
I also like dogs, and Beagles, so decided to do a play on words and use my mogo/mascot as a beagle, so my newswebsite is called the Daily Beagle!

<!--State 3 ways in which your site is accessible.-->

1. I used proper alt descriptions.  
My website provides alt description to videos, sounds and images.
I tried to make my alt descriptions short, accurate but descriptive enough for those reading to undertand clearly.

2.I used headings to organize the structure of my content.  For my headers, h1, h2, h3, I tried to be very strategic their locations and titles.  
For example, the header contained the h1 element, but secondary headers, such as the title of articles I used h2 or below ements.

3. I also gave my links unique and descriptive names.  
My links to my images always describe the content of the image. 
For example, for my image of downtown, I make sure to say downtown long beach.
Also also added descriptive names such as those for links to images of Yosemite National Park, or the military.

<!--State 3 ways in which you have considered usability in your site.-->

1. First, I maintained consistency across your site.
My website has a user friendly navigation bar at the top of each page that provide clarity to users about where they are, what other pages are available and how to get there.
This bar is the same on every single page so users know where to go to get to different locations of my site.

2. My web pages have similar layouts.  
Each page is fairly similar to each other.
I did tak some liberties in changing the body and content of each page, but they feel uniform and similar allowing for ease of use by visitors.

3. My website is very responsive no matter what you are viewing it from.
Whether you are viewing my website from a smartphone, tablet or pc, each page, from the homepage, to the gallery to the sign in, all respond well.
The pages look clean and are easy to view, navigate through an use from all devices.  

<!--State 3 things you had to learn/find out by yourself when creating your site, and describe
how you did that (i.e. what searches you did, any new tools/techniques you learned, any
changes/adaptations you made to a particular resource to make it work with your site).-->

1.  First, I learned its crucially important to understand the concept of HTML elements, tags, nesting VERY thoroughly, what they are, how they work, how to change their content.
I had to spend significant amount of time simply studying the concept of elements and nesting.
I searched studies HTML elements and attributes, looked at examples, did alot of trial and error.
I learned just to be more purposeful and strategic about the use of HTML elements and attributes and nesting.
For this part, I mainly created my own html elements and tags, and got inspiration and know how to W3School.

2. Second, its important to understand CSS tags and attributes VERY thoroughly and how to use them to modify the qualities of the very elements I had on my website.
Making changes to one declaration of a selector can have signifcant changes to other elements of the pages if one is not careful, this is where studying nesting comes in again.
I also had to study CSS syntax and syntax and selectors carefully and look up examples and do many trial and errors primary from W3School.
I utilized various selectors, declarations, properties and values, but tweeked them to the needs of my website, usually taking away or adding properties, naming selecting the way I see fit, and change the values of the properties.

3. Third, I learned evolving my site such as adding a clean looking and user friendly sign in page, adding a animation to my header of a spinning dog logo and adding a picture gallery, became easier the better I understand the fundamentals of HTML Elements and CSS Syntax, Declaration, Property and Value.
I searched and learned how to add animation, add a sign in page, create a gallery, imbed the weather of Long Beach, add sound, video, etc.
I use @keyframes for animiation, I used button onclick when creating the sign in page, I used various delcarations in CSS to create an image gallery.
I made signifcant changes to the codes I got from websites, primary W3School.
For the @keyframes, I changed the which declaration properties were and were not included. 
I made changes to the declaration values and modifed the tags of the @frames.
I use my own object (instead of square) I use a Beagle Icon I got from FontAwesome.
I made changes to the Icon's size, color, and qualities.

<!--What aspect(s) of your work do you think worked well and why?-->

I think the responsiveness of my website works very well and looks very good.  
When viewing my website from a laptop or pc screen or a tablet or iphone, the the website responds and the elements change their size and shape.
The look is very clean and I'm very proud of that part. 
This took some know how of floats, which took alot of trial, error and frustration, but I think it turned out well.

Also, when the sizing changes, the animation of the dog logo spinning is activiated. 
I also think that was very smooth as well.  
I also think the structure of my website is very organized. 
Every page is easy to identify and easy to navigate to, and the contents of each page are logical to its title.

<!--What aspect(s) of your work could be improved, and how might you do things differently
another time?-->

I think if I had more time, I would make more changes to the font, font families and logos. 
Unfortunately, not all fonts, or fonts I may have wanted to use, work with all browsers.
I had to be very sensitive about this, about my readers, when selecting a font that is pleasant to look at, creative, but also easy to read.
Changing the font can have signifcant value. 
Steve Jobs CEO studied calligraphy and it played a major role in Apple and the development of their products.
For now, I just need to be safe, but later, I'll experiment with more types of font such as Google Font.

I also would have liked to explore color theory more, and experiment with more diverse color combinations and ascents.
For now, I wanted to have a very functioning and clean website, with red accents, but later, I'd like to study color theory.

<!--What resources were used when creating your work? You should list here any sources of

I used the following W3School site when building the following aspect of my website:

I also used the following sites for images:

Taking things from the web

You can use almost anything you like that you can find on the Web, but you should avoid
anything that is not open (e.g. that costs money or requires login or registration), or
anything from sites belonging to commercial companies. Being able to re-use other people's
ideas is an important web skill. However, it is essential that, on your report page, you
describe what you have taken, where you took it from, and what you have done to it. If you
copy-and-paste something almost without change, you must say that you have done it, it
must conform to the standards, and you shouldn't expect many marks for it, except for how
you have made it fit in with and enhance your own design. To get more marks you can use
code from elsewhere, document the source of the code in your report.html and then edit it
in some way. Showing you can adapt existing code will earn you more marks. In order to be
clear which material you have written and which you have used from elsewhere you will be
expected to provide comprehensive comments within your HTML, CSS and Javascript files
indicating code you have used, code you have adopted and edited and code that you have
written.
